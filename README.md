# Workday Scheduler Application - Mowlesar Kahtiramalanathan

## Description 

This application will allow users to track their current workday and set tasks for themselves. My motivation 
for this project was to test my skills as a developer in regards to third party APIs. 

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Users can track their day as the provided timebocks within the application are colour coded to inform the user of where they are exactly in terms of a standard 9 to 5 workday. The current hour is coloured red while the upcoming hours and past hours are grey and green respectively. Furthermore users are able to input tasks via text within the timeblocks themeselves. These tasks will persist even if the user closes the app or reloads it as they are stored locally and retreived each time. 

## Credits

I would like to thank Jquery, Day.js and ChatGBT in completing this application.
